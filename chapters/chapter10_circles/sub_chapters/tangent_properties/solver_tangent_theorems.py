# ðŸ“– CBSE Theorem 10.1 Proof

## **Statement**
The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact.

## **Given**
- Circle with center O
- Point P on the circle  
- Tangent line l at point P
- Radius OP

## **To Prove**
l âŠ¥ OP (tangent is perpendicular to radius)

## **Proof by Contradiction**

**Step 1:** Assume tangent l is NOT perpendicular to radius OP.

**Step 2:** If l is not perpendicular to OP, then we can drop a perpendicular from O to line l, meeting l at point Q.

**Step 3:** Since OQ âŠ¥ l and Q â‰  P (as l is not perpendicular to OP):
- In right triangle OQP: OQ < OP (perpendicular is shortest distance)

**Step 4:** This means Q is inside the circle (as OQ < radius).

**Step 5:** But then line l passes through:
- Point Q (inside the circle)
- Point P (on the circle)
- Points beyond P (outside the circle)

**Step 6:** This means l intersects the circle at more than one point, contradicting the definition of a tangent.

**Step 7:** Therefore, our assumption is wrong, and l must be perpendicular to OP.

## **Alternative Proof (Direct)**

**Step 1:** Take any point X on tangent l (X â‰  P).

**Step 2:** Since l is tangent, X lies outside the circle.
- Therefore: OX > OP (radius)

**Step 3:** In triangle OPX:
- OX > OP means âˆ OPX < 90Â° would make OX smaller
- But OX must be > OP for all points X on l
- This is only possible if âˆ OPX = 90Â°

## **Conclusion** âœ…
The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact.

## **Applications**
- Construction of tangents
- Solving circle geometry problems
- Finding angles in tangent-related figures

    Prove Theorem 10.2: Equal tangent lengths from external point
    """
    return """
# ðŸ“– CBSE Theorem 10.2 Proof

## **Statement**
The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.

## **Given**
- Circle with center O
- External point P
- Two tangents PA and PB from P to circle
- A and B are points of contact

## **To Prove**
PA = PB (tangent lengths are equal)

## **Proof**

**Step 1:** Consider triangles â–³OAP and â–³OBP

**Step 2:** In â–³OAP and â–³OBP:
- OA = OB (both are radii of the same circle)
- âˆ OAP = âˆ OBP = 90Â° (tangent âŠ¥ radius, by Theorem 10.1)
- OP = OP (common side)

**Step 3:** By RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side) congruence:
- â–³OAP â‰… â–³OBP

**Step 4:** Since triangles are congruent:
- Corresponding sides are equal
- Therefore: **PA = PB**

## **Alternative Proof using Coordinate Geometry**

**Step 1:** Let circle have center O(0,0) and radius r
- External point P(h,k) where hÂ² + kÂ² > rÂ²

**Step 2:** For any tangent from P to circle:
- Length = âˆš[hÂ² + kÂ² - rÂ²] (using tangent length formula)

**Step 3:** Since the formula gives same result for all tangents from P:
- All tangent lengths from P are equal

## **Conclusion** âœ…
The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.

## **Applications**
- Calculating tangent lengths
- Solving quadrilateral problems involving circles
- Finding angles in circle geometry
